                <p>5-Star Lock, 10-Star Lock, 20-Star Guaranteed Lock, SEC Lock-of-the-Year, destroy you’re bookie weekend.  If you are reading this, you have probably seen these “Tout” declarations.  All Gimmicks.  Think about it.  You’re checking out the Don Best Schedule Booklet when you come across a banner proclaiming “Big 10 Pick of the Year.”  Really?!  The Booklet was printed a month prior to the schedule even starting!  Yet people fall for it.  Why?  Because they want a winner.  Let’s face it, sports gambling is exciting.  Sports gambling in fun.  But sports gambling is tough business.  The best services, touts, game pickers, whatever you want to call them, have winning percentages of 58-61 percent.  That’s right, and these guys are the best in the business.  Most services provide less than 50 percent winners, and thus lose you money.  In other words, you’re paying for someone to pick losers for you.  As if paying the book isn’t bad enough!  Back in the day of phone calls to the Book, a friend of mine had business cards with his phone number and a line stating “Eleven to a Dime, Any Ol’ Time!”  Don’t let anyone try to tell you winning money on sports is easy pickens, it’s not.  But yet, you can win.</p>
                <p>My partner and I are retired bookmakers with over 70 years combined experience involving sports gambling. We chose to get back in the game by offering this service. We’ve pretty much seen it all.  It’s a much different business these days compared to just 10 or 15 years ago.  The Internet has enabled line moves to occur almost simultaneously across the casinos and sports books.  Placing wagers can be a 24/7 proposition.  There are more games (many with teams you haven’t even heard of), more available lines, prop bets, even in-game wagering.  Hell, this year there were over 400 prop bets on the Super Bowl.  400!!  We have witnessed hot/cold streaks, winning/losing seasons, good/bad years.  But one thing hasn’t changed, and that’s what it takes to win. </p>

                <p>Congratulations, and happy you are here!  Now let’s talk about winning.  To win at sports gambling, the bettor needs a system, a plan.  This plan will require money management, discipline, patience, and knowledge.</p>
                <p><span>MONEY MANAGEMENT:</span>  Critical.  Don’t bet what you can’t afford to lose!  It’s like budgeting.  Determine how much of your disposable cash you are willing to lose.  This amount may be annual or seasonal, it really doesn’t matter.  But whatever the time frame, break it down to a weekly amount.  That’s your budget for the week.  If you lose this, you are finished for the week.  Don’t CHASE.  Always be able to come back for the following week.  </p>
                <p><span>DISCIPLINE/PATIENCE:</span>  Discipline and patience go hand-in-hand.  Winning takes time.  Seasons average six to seven months.  You don’t want to be out of the game in a month or two.  Stick to your budget.   Resolve to yourself that there will be good weeks as well as bad weeks.  It’s part of the game.  It’s gambling!  Maintain these traits and you can enjoy what you are doing and sleep at night, stress free. </p>
                <p><span>KNOWLEDGE:</span>  This is where we come in.  We are going to use these seventy plus years of experience to help you pick the right games on the schedule.  But first things first.  <span>ALL BETS ARE EQUAL.</span>  What we mean is determine an amount you want to bet on a game.  This is called your unit play.  You will see various services trying to get you to bet 3X, 5X even 10X your unit, depending on their picks. This is a sure way to lose.  Don’t fall for it and don’t do it.  That line maker has made all bets equal, so bet them equally.  Lose one 5X game and it takes five wins to make up for it (Discipline).  Next, forget the exotics.  The picks we provide are for straight bets.  No parlays, no teasers, and don’t buy points.  Sure, hitting a three teamer is a nice payout, but the odds on hitting it is what cost the bettor money.  Finally, follow our plays.  By 3PM EST, we will release our daily picks (two hours prior to game time on weekends and holidays).  We will bring an average of three picks daily, but if there is only one or two, its because we just don’t like the sheet.  On the weekends, we may bring early picks (day games) followed by late entries (night games), again based on the sheet.  These picks will also be on teams you have heard of.  We won’t be having you bet on any obscure teams.  So that’s it.  Follow this system and you will win. </p>
